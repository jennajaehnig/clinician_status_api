# Clinician GeoLocate
This project is a security feature that uses a Clinician Status API to send an email alert within 5 minutes of a phlebotomist leaving the expected zone around a patientâ€™s home.

### Quick Start:
Download the three python files and run api.py with the command `python3 api.py`. The program will then run the service until a keyboard interrupt. You may change the number of clinicians in `api.py` and the recipient email in `email_helper.py`.
